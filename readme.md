This project is a small utility for creating clean arch models (model, domain, entity) and converters from
existing entities.

### Do you need go and web assembly for that use case?
Absolutely not. This project was used to experiment with the technologies and
is by no means a reference implementation for the given use case.

### Technologies
* [Go](https://go.dev/) for the core (compiled as [wasm](https://webassembly.org/))
* [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the frontend
